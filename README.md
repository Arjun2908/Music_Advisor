## Project: Music Advisor

### About
Modern world spoils us with a wide variety of music: pop-lovers, rockers, rappers and club enthusiasts alike face a nearly infinite choice. Fortunately, there are programs that can help us find something we like and not get lost in this variety: in this project, I made a program like this. I created a personal music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to new releases and featured playlists. Together with Spotify, this music advisor is a powerful guide to the world of music.
### Learning outcomes
I learned: working with Spotifyâ€™s API, got acquainted with Java Generics and applied design patterns to make my code from good to superb!
### How to run
